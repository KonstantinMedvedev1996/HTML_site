    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>


        <span class="bold-text">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</span> is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
        such as <span style="font-style: oblique; background-color:rgb(191, 15, 153);">Cascading Style Sheets
            (CSS)</span> and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.


    </p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of <a href="#">HTML</a> pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
        objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <a href="https://youtube.com">HTML</a> provides a
        means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
        p and p surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
        display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. </p>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a <a href="https://yandex.ru">scripting language</a> such as <a
            href="https://google.com" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a
            href="second_page.html">World Wide Web Consortium</a>
        (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
        audio, primarily using the canvas element, together with JavaScript. </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into
        visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
        and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of
        the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
        describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in
        the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were
        derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of
        generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print
        effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS. </p>

    <p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet
        Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the
        "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML
        Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for
        its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's
        philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft,
        "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like
        tables and fill-out forms</p>
